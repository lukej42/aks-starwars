                "the words 'Jedi' and 'Sith' had hardened into opposing orders. On [Tython](planet/tython), "
                "Force-sensitive settlers discovered that the energy binding all life could be "
                "studied, balanced, and channeled through discipline rather than superstition."
            ),
            "history": (
                "Galactic civilization in this epoch was shaped less by unified government than by "
                "the Tho Yor — mysterious pyramidal vessels that gathered Force-sensitive beings "
                "from across the galaxy and deposited them on Tython. There, amid nine distinct "
                "Temples aligned to the planet's moons and Force nexuses, the Je'daii Order arose. "
                "They named the light side Ashla and the dark side Bogan, teaching that imbalance "
                "between the two invited catastrophe — a philosophy that would echo in the later "
                "[Jedi Code](the-force/jedi-code) and its shadow counterpart, the [Sith Code](the-force/sith-code).\n\n"
                "Je'daii society was itinerant and rigorous. Adepts traveled between Temples — "
                "Mahra Kesh for alchemy, Anil Kesh for science, Kaleth for philosophy — and were "
                "exiled to Tython's moon Ashla or Bogan when they fell too far toward one pole of "
                "the Force. This institutional balance was not pacifism; Je'daii masters wielded "
                "swords, staves, and early forms of what would become lightsaber combat when "
                "metal-forging and Adegan crystal lore matured on worlds like Ilum.\n\n"
                "The Rakata Infinite Empire cast a long shadow across pre-Republic space. Using "
                "Force-powered hyperdrive technology and enslaving countless species, the Rakata "
                "built Star Forge-scale monuments and seeded worlds with their architecture. Their "
                "empire's collapse — brought on by a plague that severed their Force sensitivity — "
                "left hyperspace routes fractured and worlds like Lehon (Rakata Prime) abandoned, "
                "but their legacy of dark-side superweapons haunted later ages.\n\n"
                "The schism that ended the Je'daii golden age began when a faction led by "
                "Ajunta Pall and other Dark Jedi rejected exile and embraced Bogan as a path to "
                "power rather than a warning. Cast out after the Hundred-Year Darkness, these "
                "exiles conquered the Sith species on Korriban and interbred with them, forging "
                "the first Sith Lords. Their departure from Tython did not destroy Je'daii culture "
                "overnight, but it permanently split the galaxy's Force traditions into competing "
                "bloodlines of light and darkness.\n\n"
                "By roughly 25,000 BBY, the Je'daii had evolved into the Jedi Order as historians "
                "later understood it — monastic, temple-centered, and increasingly aligned with "
                "the emerging Galactic Republic's democratic ideals. Ossus became a great library "
                "world; Tython itself would be abandoned and revisited across millennia whenever "
                "the Order sought its forgotten roots.\n\n"
                "Legends sources such as *Star Wars: Dawn of the Jedi* and the *Je'daii* comic "
                "series flesh out characters like Xesh, Daegen Lok, and Shae Koda, while modern "
                "canon references in *The Acolyte* and High Republic materials treat Tython and "
                "the balance philosophy as living precedents for every later debate about "
                "attachment, prophecy, and the danger of suppressing the dark side rather than "

                "Every subsequent Force tradition in Star Wars is, in some sense, a footnote to "

                "Jedi feared emotional attachment, why Sith define freedom through passion, and "
                "why the galaxy keeps rediscovering the same lesson: unchecked power — light or "
                "dark — reshapes civilization at catastrophic scale.\n\n"

                "its destruction, his exile on Ahch-To, and Rey's journey to carry the "
                "light forward. It is an ongoing chronicle of restoration, failure, and "
                "renewed hope that the Force's guardians can exist without repeating the "
                "Old Order's fatal compromises."

            "history": (
                "When the Empire fell at Endor, the Jedi were a memory — two survivors "
                "in hiding and a handful of texts scattered across the galaxy. Luke "
                "Skywalker, the farmboy who redeemed Darth Vader, shouldered the burden "
                "of rebuilding. He recovered holocrons, searched ruins on Ossus and "
                "Devaron, and eventually trained a new generation of Force users including "
                "his nephew Ben Solo and students like those who would die when the "
                "Knights of Ren attacked.\n\n"
                "The [Jedi Code](the-force/jedi-code) guided Luke's curriculum — "
                "discipline, compassion, and non-attachment — but the shadow of the "
                "Clone Wars lingered. Luke feared Ben's darkness and briefly contemplated "
                "striking him down; that moment of hesitation helped push Ben toward "
                "Snoke and the dark side. The temple burning (~28 ABY) broke Luke's "
                "faith; he exiled himself to Ahch-To, site of the first Jedi temple, "
                "intending to die with the Order.\n\n"
                "Rey's emergence from Jakku reopened the path. Guided by Leia, Han, "
                "and the legacy voices of Obi-Wan and Yoda, she found Luke and demanded "
                "training. On Ahch-To, Luke taught her the Force's breadth — including "
                "its painful history — before sacrificing himself at Crait so the "
                "Resistance could survive. Rey carried his sabers, faced Palpatine on "
                "Exegol, and took the name Skywalker as honorific, not bloodline.\n\n"
                "Parallel threads enrich this era: Grogu trained under Luke at Ossus "
                "before returning to Din Djarin; Ahsoka Tano searched for Ezra Bridger "
                "in the Unknown Regions; Cal Kestis gathered survivors in *Jedi: Survivor*. "
                "Each story asks the same question — can the Jedi exist without the "
                "Republic's bureaucracy, without armies, without the hubris that doomed "
                "the prequel Order?\n\n"
                "The [Sith Code](the-force/sith-code) appeared defeated when Vader "
                "killed Palpatine at Endor, yet Sidious's clone body on Exegol proved "
                "the dark side's persistence. Rey's victory — supported by a chorus of "
                "past Jedi — suggested a new model: not a massive temple on Coruscant, "
                "but adaptable guardians embedded in the galaxy's fabric.\n\n"
                "As an open-ended era, the New Jedi Order continues in series, games, "
                "and future films — a promise that the Force's light side can be "
                "relearned after every catastrophe, and that the name 'Jedi' remains "

                "whatever comes next. Luke's failure with Ben is as important as his "
                "success with Rey: the Order must evolve or repeat history.\n\n"
                "Rey's yellow saber and Skywalker name signal intentional reinvention "
                "rather than restoration of old structures. Grogu, Ezra, and Cal represent "
                "distributed Jedi futures outside centralized temples.\n\n"
